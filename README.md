🔍 NakedPolicy
Privacy Policies. Terms. Cookies. Simplified.

NakedPolicy is an intelligent browser extension that breaks down complex legal documents — privacy policies, terms & conditions, cookie notices, and codes of conduct — into simple, human-friendly summaries.

Modern digital platforms bury users under pages of legal jargon. NakedPolicy cuts through the noise and gives you instant clarity, one line at a time.

🚨 The Problem It Solves
Every day, millions of users blindly click "Accept" without understanding what they're agreeing to. Privacy policies and terms are intentionally:

Long — Often 10,000+ words
Confusing — Written in dense legal language
Packed with jargon — Technical and legal terms everywhere
Because of this, users rarely know:

❌ What personal data is collected
❌ How it's used or shared
❌ How long it's stored
❌ What rights they actually have
❌ What cookies and trackers are running in the background

This lack of transparency puts people at risk of unwanted tracking, data misuse, and unfair terms.

� How NakedPolicy Helps
NakedPolicy brings transparency to the digital world with:

✅ One-Line Legal Summaries
Transforms lengthy, complex documents into short, digestible insights — section by section.

🔍 Clarity on Data Collection
Shows exactly what data is being collected, how it's used, and who it's shared with.

🍪 Simple Cookie Explanations
Explains tracking technologies in plain language — no tech background required.

⚡ Instant, Informed Consent
Helps users make smart privacy decisions before clicking "Accept".

✨ Core Features
🤖 Real-time Policy Summarization using AI (Google Gemini)
📊 Section-wise Breakdown for easier understanding
🍪 Cookie and Tracker Detection
🚨 Risk Indicators (e.g., high data sharing, third-party usage, profiling)
🎯 Dual-Mode Summaries — 50-word quick view + 1000-word detailed analysis
🌐 Web Application — Upload and analyze any policy document
🔌 Chrome Extension — Instant analysis on any website
🎨 Clean, Distraction-Free UI
🌍 Cross-Browser Support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge — planned)
